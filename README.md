# Sales of Products Predictions & Forged Banknotes Classification

<!-- introduction -->
## About The Project

## Sales of Products Predictions

Predicting the sales of the products given the TV, radio, and newspaper ad budgets using linear regression and SGDRegressor models. The prediction began by Normalizing the data using a standard scaler. After that, the data was split into train/test. Then the two models were built. Finally, the two models were evaluated by using the mean squared error and R2 score.

## Forged Banknotes Classification

Classifying forged banknotes using a logistic regression model that can distinguish between genuine and forged banknotes given features extracted from their images. The classification began by Normalizing the data using a standard scaler. After that, the data was split into train/test. Then the logistic regression model was built. Then, the model was evaluated using an accuracy score, precision score, recall score, and confusion matrix. Finally, a set of different classification thresholds were tested to find the optimal one.
