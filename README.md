# Sales of Products Predictions & Forged Banknotes Classification

<!-- introduction -->
## About The Project

## Sales of Products Predictions

Using linear regression and SGDRegressor models to predict the sales of products based on the TV, radio, and newspaper ad budgets. The first step of the project was to normalize the data using a standard scaler, which ensures that all the features are on the same scale and helps improve the performance of the models. The data was then split into train and test sets to train and evaluate the models. Two models were built, namely, linear regression and SGDRegressor. The models were evaluated using two metrics: mean squared error (MSE) and R2 score.

## Forged Banknotes Classification

Building a logistic regression model to classify banknotes as either genuine or forged, based on features extracted from their images. To prepare the data, a standard scaler was used to normalize it, and the data was then split into training and testing sets. The logistic regression model was then built, and its performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. Finally, a range of classification thresholds was tested to determine the optimal one.
